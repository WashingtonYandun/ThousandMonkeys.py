    "In this project, we are delving into the realm of modeling and simulation using Python. Our endeavor centers around the intriguing concept of the 'Infinite Monkey Theorem.' This theorem posits that given an infinite number of monkeys equipped with typewriters and an infinite amount of time, they would eventually produce all possible literary works, including those of Shakespeare, purely by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to simulate this phenomenon through the lens of modeling and simulation using Python. By harnessing the power of randomness and algorithms, we will endeavor to mimic the hypothetical scenario where monkeys randomly generate text. Through iterations and comparisons, we will gauge the similarity of their output with a target text. While a simplistic approach, this simulation will serve as a fascinating exploration of probabilistic and computational concepts, offering us insights into the intricacies of chance, randomness, and the infinite\n"
